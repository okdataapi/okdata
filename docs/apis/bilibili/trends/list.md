## Questions

### How much does the Bilibili popular board API cost?

One call costs $0.002 and returns one page of about 50 board entries. Collecting 1,000 board entries takes about 20 calls, $0.04 in total. Each page is a separate call; failed calls are not charged.

### How do I get the next page?

Pass page.next_cursor from the response back as the cursor parameter. When page.has_more is false there is nothing left. Every page is its own call at $0.002.

### Do I need a Bilibili account, cookies or a QR login?

No. You send only your okdata API key. The data is public data from Bilibili; nothing is fetched with your own Bilibili account.

### Am I charged when a call fails?

No. Every error response says charged: false, except a timeout, which says charged: null until the outcome is known. Resend with the same Idempotency-Key and you are never charged twice.

### What if Bilibili does not show a field?

The field is null, and meta.unavailable names it with the reason: platform (the platform never shows it) or capability (we cannot fetch it yet).
