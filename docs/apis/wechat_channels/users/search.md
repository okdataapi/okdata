## Errors

Errors share one shape: code, request_id, message and message_zh (a fixed sentence per code), charged, retry, retry_after_seconds, param and docs_url, with the specifics in problems. They are not charged; only settlement_unknown is unknown until looked up. The full table: https://okdata.online/docs/errors/

## Questions

### How much does the WeChat Channels account search API cost?

One call costs $0.02 and returns one page of about 1 accounts. Collecting 1,000 accounts takes about 1000 calls, $20.00 in total. Each page is a separate call; failed calls are not charged.

### How do I get the next page?

Pass page.next_cursor from the response back as the cursor parameter. When page.has_more is false there is nothing left. Every page is its own call at $0.02.

### Do I need a WeChat Channels account, cookies or a QR login?

No. You send only your okdata API key. The data is public data from WeChat Channels; nothing is fetched with your own WeChat Channels account.

### Am I charged when a call fails?

No. Every error response says charged: false, except a timeout, which says charged: null until the outcome is known. Resend with the same Idempotency-Key and you are never charged twice.

### What if WeChat Channels does not show a field?

The field is null, and meta.unavailable names it with the reason: platform (the platform never shows it) or capability (we cannot fetch it yet).
