## Errors

Errors share one shape: code, request_id, message and message_zh (a fixed sentence per code), charged, retry, retry_after_seconds, param and docs_url, with the specifics in problems. They are not charged; only settlement_unknown is unknown until looked up. The full table: https://okdata.online/docs/errors/

## Questions

### How much does the Reddit video transcript API cost?

One call costs $0.004 and returns one transcript. 1,000 lookups cost $4.00. Failed calls are not charged.

### Can I pass a share link instead of an ID?

Yes. Put the link in url and okdata reads the ID from it. Short share links work too.

### Do I need a Reddit account, cookies or a QR login?

No. You send only your okdata API key. The data is public data from Reddit; nothing is fetched with your own Reddit account.

### Am I charged when a call fails?

No. Every error response says charged: false, except a timeout, which says charged: null until the outcome is known. Resend with the same Idempotency-Key and you are never charged twice.

### What if Reddit does not show a field?

The field is null, and meta.unavailable names it with the reason: platform (the platform never shows it) or capability (we cannot fetch it yet).
